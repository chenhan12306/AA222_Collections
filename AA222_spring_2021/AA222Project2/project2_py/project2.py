Note: Do not import any other modules here.
        To import from another file xyz.py here, type
        import project2_py.xyz
        However, do not import any modules except numpy in those files.
        It's ok to import modules only in files that are
        not imported here (e.g. for your plotting code).

    Args:
        f (function): Function to be optimized
        g (function): Gradient function for `f`
        c (function): Function evaluating constraints
        x0 (np.array): Initial position to start from
        n (int): Number of evaluations allowed. Remember `f` and `c` cost 1 and `g` costs 2
        count (function): takes no arguments are reutrns current count
        prob (str): Name of the problem. So you can use a different strategy 
                 for each problem. `prob` can be `simple1`,`simple2`,`simple3`,
                 `secret1` or `secret2`
